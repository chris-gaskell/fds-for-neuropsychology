i.  CP here to talk about FDS
ii. Little about me.
iii. CP in neuropsychology, some of my past experience has been working within specialist tertiary care services for patients experiencing these conditions.
iv. I also have a part-time academic role, and a reasonably portion of that is spent supervising DClinPsy students on a variety of FND releated projects.

-   Introduction

-   `Background` to Functional Dissociative Seizures

-   Importance of `Language` {{< fa comment-dots >}}

-   The `Evidence` base {{< fa chart-simple >}}

::: notes
-   I am going to talk to you about FDS, focusing more on the general background, language, and the evidence base; and then in about 25 minutes my colleague Antonia is going to talk to you about delivering treatment.

-   This will be a whistle-stop tour, on topics that could easily have who days spent to them. For those who are interested in the topics I have discussed today then I have embedded lots of references to further reading.

> `Functional Dissociative Seizure` <br>Disruption of usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception (Goldstein et al., 2000). <br><br> Episodes which superficially resemble epileptic seizures or syncope, but which are not associated with the same physiological changes which underpin these conditions (Reuber, 2008).

<br>

-   `Functional` referring to an impairment of normal functioning.

-   FDS are one manifestation of FND.

-   People with FDS often have other symptoms.

::: notes
-   Lots of other terms to describe FDS (to discuss later).
-   Epilepsy but without the same underlying electrical processes. Different brain structural changes.
-   Discrimination is essential for providing the most appropriate treatment.
-   Seizures are one manifestation, often within complex broader FND constellations.
-   FND is the umbrella term however there are often other symptoms that accompany it. 93% fatigue; 81% memory problem; 70% headache; to name but a few.

## Who Makes The Diagnosis?

Usually made by a Neurologist or Neuropsychiatrist.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Assessments can include:

-   Clinical history.

-   Videos & subjective experience.

-   EEG (electroencephalogram).

-   ECG (electrocardiogram).

-   Video telemetry.

Psychologists don't diagnose however we do provide support (communicating and explaining).

::: notes
-   In order to provide understanding and appropriate treatments we need accurate and prompt diagnosis. The importance of sensitively delivered diagnosis can't be overstated.

-   Diagnosis is challenging because of the need to carefully rule out epilepsy. And to be sure it isn't it can require lots of assessments.

-   More assessments = more time. As the assessments are far from perfect it's common for FDS to be first misdiagnosed as epilepsy.

-   In order to increase the chance of an accurate diagnosis, it is important that the person is seen by someone who is particularly familiar seizure conditions.

-   **Video-telemetry:** inpatient admission so that the person can be observed and recorded having seizures.

-   Psychologists have a role in diagnosis too. Not making it, but often explaining it and helping the patient to make sense of it. Some people attend who report having not been told about the diagnosis.
:::

## Diagnostic Challenges

Difficult to distinguish from other conditions

-   Heterogeneity of seizure conditions.

-   Long duration from onset to diagnosis[^1].

Problems of this include:

-   Functional seizures treated epileptic seizure protocols[^2].

-   Prolonged use of anti-convulsants.

-   Lack of access to necessary support and treatment.

::: notes
Just to reinforce some of the dilemmas around diagnosis.

-   Journey to diagnosis can be very long. When using gold standard assessment (VT) mean duration of 8.4 years (median = 3) ([Kerr et al., 2021](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1059131121000510?token=89B6F73BFDD3927128DB3620BA782BDC2C029A17A0DAE3B74C41E58725B0F2BC506713D8EBD8439C4A829038111E3159&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20230316115621))

-   Response to functional seizures with seizure protocols (very common, see [Jungilligens et al., 2021](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/early/2021/08/16/jnnp-2021-326443.full.pdf)).

-   Among 1210 patients presenting with prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) 8% went on to receive a diagnosis of FDS

-   Are are not diagnosticians but I think it can be helpful to know some of the semiological features that are more reliable for discriminating between conditions.

## How Common Is FDS?

**Prevalence:** Challenging to calculate[^4].

[^4]: In the absence of well-resourced, formal epidemiological studies and confounded by diagnostic delays.

    Kanemoto, K., LaFrance Jr., W. C., Duncan, R., Gigineishvili, D., Park, S.-P., Tadokoro, Y., Ikeda, H., Paul, R., Zhou, D., Taniguchi, G., Kerr, M., Oshima, T., Jin, K., & Reuber, M. (2017).

-   Norway: 24/100,000[^5] (95% CI = 18–30).
-   Subsequently estimated 50,000–100,000 people in the UK[^6].

**Incidence:**

-   Norway: 3.1/100,000 per year (95% CI = 2.4–3.7).

-   UK (older study): 4.09/100,000[^7].

**Healthcare:**

-   8-12% of presentations to first seizure clinics[^8].

-   11% of seizures presenting to emergency services[^9].

-   20–30% of patients referred to epilepsy centers with intractable seizures[^10].

[^10]: The vast majority of these patients are eventually diagnosed with PNES.

::: notes
-   It's difficult to accurately quantify prevalence rates.
-   Few epidemiology studies and non from the UK (population-level studies).
-   Rare condition (although may not feel it).
-   Accounts for:
    -   Approx 10% of people attending to a first seizure neurology clinic.
    -   Approx 10% of seizures that present to A&E.
    -   Approx a quarter of patients referred to epilepsy centers with intractable epilepsy.

::: notes
Lots of information out there about risk factors for FDS.

Take home point is that they don't consistently discriminate. No risk factor can explain every presentation of FDS and there is broadly a consensus that the cause of FDS for many people is likely to be multi-factorial.

In short, FDS is more common in women around the ages of 20 to 40, although modal age of onset is 16, and there are elevated rates of FDS in:

-   LD.

-   People of low SES.

-   Epilepsy, brain injury, migraine.

-   Physical and mental health comorbidities.

-   And trauma (38%).

Although Rates are high, many people with FND do NOT report having experienced any trauma.

**Age:**

-   Modal age of onset is 16. mean and median = 28.

-   Age disparity dissipates in late adulthood.

**Epilepsy:**

-   12--22% Dual diagnosis (meta-analysis).

-   Challenging to diagnose

**LD:**

-   Median = 9.4% of comorbid ID was found across eleven PNES cohorts (Rawlings et al., 2021).

**Demographics:**

-   Over 50% of all patients live in areas categorised within the highest deprivation quintile

-   Over two- thirds of patients being unemployed at the point of seeking treatment for PNES (Goldstein *et al.*, 2019).

**Psychiatric:**

-   **PTSD:** 38%

-   Norm rather than an exception (Nicholson et al., 2020).

-   **Psychiatric conditions:** especially affective, trauma-related and/or dissociative disorders, are typically present in over 50% of most FND samples, with lifetime rates even higher.

-   **Personality disorders:** higher rate than the general population. Particularly EUPD and cluster C presentations.

-   **Epilepsy surgery:** New onset following surgery (upto 9%).

-   **TBI:** Rates vary a lot. Pooled frequency of about 42%

[^23]: Not related to the behavioural notion of 'functional analysis'

[^24]: See this video by [John Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ersm5f_0LVI&t=21s%22) or the excellent [review paper](https://www.bmj.com/content/380/bmj.p221) on 'functional' vs 'organic'

::: notes
-   Functional, does not mean behavioural; it is an impairment of function.

-   The 'Functional vs. Organic' dichotomy is quite a dominant discourse, particularly in neuropsychology, but it's important to remind ourselves of the limitations of this distinction.

-   Functional vs organic fits the existing healthcare system quite well; but that is largely because our healthcare is heavily built on mind-body dualism; just look at the distinction between physical and mental health care. FND and FDS are conditions that illustrate very well how this distinction is certainly not as clear cut as people think.

-   What organic symptoms are not in some way mediated by psychological processes? and if someone has limb weakness for many years, then could motor patterns not go on to influence brain structure through plasticity?

-   Jon Stone makes an interesting point about the term organic being completely flawed, in an interesting paper called A tale of two turnips. I cannot do it justice, but maybe consider how anything in our very consciousness not be organic. Consciousness must arise from organic matter at some level. Structural.

ILAE[^25] have forwarded the position of adopting `Functional Dissociative Seizure`

[^25]: International League Against Epilepsy

::: notes
1.  Almost everything in the universe is “nonepileptic”.
2.  Patient organisations (FNDhope, FNDaction) want a different label.
3.  International nosologies (DSM, ICD) use the terms “functional’ or “dissociative” seizures and it would be much better for all concerned if we could agree on a single term (although functional/dissociative seizures is clearly a compromise in this regard).

# Treatment: Evidence & Measurement {background-color="#01364C" style="font-size: 35px; text-align: left;"}

## Role of Psychology

-   Generally well suited to the treatment of FDS (but not suitable for everyone).

-   Should co-morbidity be accounted for?

![](files/img/smoke-not-fire.jpg){fig-align="center" width="400"}

::: notes
-   The paroxysmal role fairly well suited to psychological interventions (e.g., BT, CBT).

-   FND can respond; but may need MDT input.

-   The need to treat any pre-existing MH is important, irrespective of FND.

-   Whether it is absolutely necessary to prioritize treatment of underlying mental health as opposed to more targeted work in managing seizures, is debatable, and I am not sure we have great data to say one way or the other.

-   Some people may show great benefit from seizure management strategies while they are waiting comprehensive mental health;

-   I suspect there are others, whereby you could spend months working on the seizures to little effect because the distress is being maintained at a much deeper level. And continuing to target seizures in this situations is akin to wafting at smoke while ignoring the flames.

::: notes
-   Lots of evidence for treatments functional seizures; although much of it is quite low quality, and mostly focused upon behavioral and CBT interventions.
-   Most focuses on seizure reduction, which is understandable because that is usually what people want to change when they arrive for treatment.
-   The problem however is that the evidence for psychological treatments for seizures frequency is mixed. Practice-based studies tend to show very impressive rates of seizure freedom (roughly 1 in 2) however the one high quality RCT for FDS found no difference to standard care.
-   So some been argued that psychological treatment may be less influential than we would hope for seizure frequency; however there are a lot of methodological problems in outcome research for FDS, least of which is how to accurately measure and count seizures, so it is quite hard to conclude anything definitively.
-   That said, RCTs have found far more impressive findings for other outcomes, such as mental health, functioning, and quality of life, to name just a few.
-   Not enough time to go into detail, but there isn't evidence supportive of medication, and there is some emerging evidence for neuro-modulation but it's far too early to say how effective or suitable they are.
