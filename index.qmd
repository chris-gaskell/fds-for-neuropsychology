\- Brief explanation. epilepsy but without the same underlying electrical processes. Different brain structural changes.

\- Really important because treatments for seizures are not effective for functional seizures.

\- FND is an umbrella term that captures all the different types of seemingly neurological symptoms.

## Symptom Heterogeneity {visibility="hidden"}

Classified by [neurosymptoms.org](https://www.neurosymptoms.org/en_GB/symptoms/), extracted 2021

![](files/img/neurosymptoms-types.png){fig-align="center" width="1400" height="1000"}

::: notes
-   FND takes many shapes and forms. The symptoms that one person experiences for FND may look very different to another persons experiences. This is what we call heterogeneity.As the constellation of symptoms that individuals experience can be so different, it is inherently difficult to classify subtypes. What we can do however is group the types of symptoms that people tend to experience. This grid is based on the euro symptoms website which is a fantastic resource. For each of these categories of symptoms there is a attached information sheet for patients and professionals to download.
-   Working in and then EAD service, the people that I see all experience some form of functional seizure. Despite this, the vast majority of patients will also experience another form of functional symptom.
-   Pretty much anything neurological!
-   Lots of people presenting to the NEAD service experience other symptoms.

::: notes
-   These visualisations come from a recent survey of people living with FND.
-   This is the largest survey of this kind. As you can see on the right hand side from the symptom cooccurrence network there is a high comorbidity of various forms of symptoms with FND.
-   Quite concerning are the rates of co-occurance with other symptoms which are not core FND symptoms, for example 93% of people with FND also experience fatigue.
-   From the visual analog clock on the left you can see the responses to a range of questions from people living with FND. Quite interesting is the response to the question "Cause a combination of physical/stress", is very high. This is a little insight as to what people with FND believe the cause of it to be, and based on this it is both physical and stress related.
-   Heterogeneity.
-   Co-occurance network.
-   Biggest survey conducted on FND.
-   50% of people had seizures. 93% had fatigue!
-   VAS - caused by physical and emotional factors.

## Diagnosis {visibility="hidden"}

**Functional Neurological Symptoms Disorder (DSM-V)**

-   Inclusion term to Conversion Disorder

-   Requires motor and/or sensory findings.

-   Incompatibility between symptom and recognised structural neurological/medical conditions (APA, 2013, Stone et al., 2010b).

-   Must impair social/occupational functioning.

-   No duration or severity criteria, or explicit rules for exclusion based on additional symptoms.

**Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder (ICD-11)**

-   Much push back on terminology from FND charities and specialists around the world.

## Not to be Confused With {visibility="hidden"}

**Malingering:** Deliberately manufacturing symptoms for material gain e.g. Money.

**Factitious Disorder:** Deliberately manufacturing symptoms for emotional gain e.g. Attention.

FND is [not]{.underline} Malingering! (see [Edwards et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-022-00765-z))

::: notes
Do not mistake symptoms for factitious/malingering just because it doesn't fit with what your framework.

-   Big take away message = real experience.

-   This is really important because there is a history of people with FND not being believed or been described as "faking".
:::

## Functional Seizures {visibility="hidden"}

-   One manifestation/constellation of FND.

-   Within DSM-V classified as conversion disorder/functional neurological symptom disorder.

-   **"Functional"** referring to an impairment of normal functioning.

-   Disruption of usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception (Goldstein et al., 2000).

-   Temporary loss of **control and/or awareness**.

::: notes
-   The term functional has been used to describe symptoms which impacts upon neurological function but which do not have the same underlying pathological abnormality.
-   Dissociation: amnesia, fugue, dissociative id disorder, depersonalisation disorder)

# Diagnostics & Prevalence {background-color="#01364C" style="font-size: 35px; text-align: left;"}

## Who Makes The Diagnosis?

Usually made by a Neurologist or Neuropsychiatrist.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Assessments can include:

-   Clinical history

-   Videos & subjective experience

-   Objective signs

-   EEG (electroencephalogram)

-   ECG (electrocardiogram)

-   Video telemetry
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](files/eeg.jpeg)
:::
:::

Any professional who potentially comes into contact with patients has a potential role in identification and/or clarification

::: notes
-   **Key dilemma =** Prompt and accurate diagnosis.

-   **Clinicians unfamiliar =** reduced sign posting and (confidence in) diagnosis.

-   Difficult to distinguish between conditions (e.g., epilepsy and functional seizures) and may need specialist investigation of a neurologist with experience in FND.

-   **Video-telemetry:** inpatient admission so that they can be observed having seizures during the process known as video toiletry.

-   Dilemmas = delay.

![](files/img/Stone-NEAD-Table.png){width="1200" height="1200"}

## Diagnostic Challenges

Difficult to distinguish from other conditions.

-   Long duration from onset to diagnosis[^5].

-   FDS treated using epileptic seizure protocols[^6].

-   Prolonged use of anti-convulsants.

-   Lack of access to necessary support and treatment.

::: notes
Often leads to problems with:

-   Journey to diagnosis can be very long. When using gold standard assessment (VT) mean duration of 8.4 years (median = 3) ([Kerr et al., 2021](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1059131121000510?token=89B6F73BFDD3927128DB3620BA782BDC2C029A17A0DAE3B74C41E58725B0F2BC506713D8EBD8439C4A829038111E3159&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20230316115621))

-   Response to functional seizures with seizure protocols (very common, see [Jungilligens et al., 2021](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/early/2021/08/16/jnnp-2021-326443.full.pdf)).

-   Among 1210 patients diagnosed and treated as status epilepticus about 79 (8.1%) were discharged with a final diagnosis of pPNES (mean age = 32.6 years; 8 to 84 years).

-   (although 48% in same year).

## Important Notes around Diagnosis in FND {visibility="hidden"}

::: callout-important
## Important Notes around Diagnosis in FND {visibility="hidden"}

-   Based on positive clinical signs/symptoms[^7].

-   Internal inconsistency (reversibility) and/or to a lesser extent incongruency with known patterns of structural neurological disease.

-   Trauma is not required for diagnosis (more on this later).

-   Perceptions of 'diagnosis of exclusion' and hesitancy lead to damaging delays in diagnosis.

-   Following diagnosis, new symptoms are frequently (and wrongfully) dismissed.
:::

[^7]: Helpful articles on positive symptoms include [Aybeck, 2022](%22https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YZF-9aHuYeLkgAErzHXx4F-I-rC_2lNq/view) & [Finkelstein et al (2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acem.14263)

::: notes
-   For too often been a diagnosis of exclusion

-   There is clearly a need for careful examination and ruling out of other conditions HOWEVER this should not be the default position.

-   Inconsistent symptoms (mediated by other mechanisms: cognitive, emotional, physical).

    -   Example = recent man with tics.

-   Trauma not necessary (high potential to cause harm).

-   Do not dismiss. One of the most powerful thing I hear from patient with FND is the stories of how they have been left and treated by health clinicians.

    -   One of the things that repeatedly comes up is how new symptoms suddenly get dismissed when there is a dx of FND in the care notes.

## Tips for Explaining the Diagnosis {background-color="white"} {visibility="hidden"}

::: {.callout-tip style="border: black; background: #f5f5f5 5px center/3em no-repeat;"}
## Tips

-   Everyone has a role.

-   Need to be able to sensitively communicate, clarify and explain.

-   Don't use pejorative terms.

-   Bio-psycho-social explanation (be careful with psychological trigger words).

-   Validate symptoms as genuine and common.

-   Name the condition.

-   Provide a brief mechanistic explanation (e.g., "brain becomes overloaded and shuts down").

-   Foster a hopeful sentiment of improvement (eg, pointing out that treatments are available).

::: notes
-   It's difficult to accurately quantify prevalence rates.
-   Accurate data on the epidemiology of FDS are limited, with no UK population-level studies.29 A study in a Norwegian county (population 260,000) used patient registry data between 2010–2020 to describe a prevalence of 24/100,000 (95%CI 18–30) and incidence of 3.1/100,000/yr (95%CI 2.4–3.7).30 A Swedish population-level study found an incidence of 1.2/100,000/yr between 2001–2013.9 These Nordic studies may underestimate the true incidence and prevalence of FDS given that they are based on primary care coding and do not include people initially (or erroneously) diagnosed with epilepsy or those with epilepsy and FDS (up to 10% of the FDS population).31,32 A recent systematic review based on five previous studies found a prevalence of 108/100,000 (95%CI 40–178) and an incidence of 3.1/100,000/yr (95%CI 1.1–5.1).29
-   There are higher rates of mental and physical illnesses in people with FDS.5,33–35 A systematic review and meta-analysis have shown higher rates of physical symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety when compared with people with epilepsy and the general population.36,37 FDS may be more common in people with intellectual disability, with a median of 9% of people with FDS having intellectual disability across 11 cohort studies.38 However the prevalence of FDS has not been studied at population level in this neglected and vulnerable population.38,39
-   International Classification of Disease (ICD) v 10 codes (Secondary Care) F445 – Dissociative Convulsions

<!-- -->

-   Difficult to accurately quantify prevalence rates due to:

    -   diagnostic delay

    -   patients being lost to follow-up.

-   May not seem common; but patients frequently attend to A&E and psychology services so I will guarantee that pretty much everyone will work with someone at somepoint.

::: notes
**Age:**

-   Modal age of onset is 16. mean and median = 28.

-   Age disparity dissipates in late adulthood.

**Epilepsy:**

-   12--22% Dual diagnosis (meta-analysis).

-   Challenging to diagnose

**LD:**

-   Median = 9.4% of comorbid ID was found across eleven PNES cohorts (Rawlings et al., 2021).

**Demographics:**

-   Over 50% of all patients live in areas categorised within the highest deprivation quintile

-   Over two- thirds of patients being unemployed at the point of seeking treatment for PNES (Goldstein *et al.*, 2019).

**Psychiatric:**

-   **PTSD:** 38%

-   Norm rather than an exception (Nicholson et al., 2020).

-   **Psychiatric conditions:** especially affective, trauma-related and/or dissociative disorders, are typically present in over 50% of most FND samples, with lifetime rates even higher.

-   **Personality disorders:** higher rate than the general population. Particularly EUPD and cluster C presentations.

-   **Epilepsy surgery:** New onset following surgery (upto 9%).

-   **TBI:** Rates vary a lot. Pooled frequency of about 42%

## Trauma {visibility="hidden"}

-   **Traumatic event:** incident causing physical, emotional or psychological harm.

-   Single event or repeated incidents (i.e., complex).

-   Recent or a long time ago.

-   Highly common in FDS (compared to case controls, [Ludwig et al., 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/%20S2215-0366(18)30051-8)).

-   Does not consistently explain aetiology or onset.

-   Not always helpful to ask.

-   Be careful with the notions of conversion. It may be relevant for some [but not all]{.underline}.

::: notes
-   Trauma does not explain why one patient gets a seizure and another paralysis
-   Nor does an abusive experience 10 years ago explain why the symptom starts on the 7th Sept 2017
-   Sometimes more helpful to ask about the emotional reaction to sudden onset physical symptoms.
-   The magnitude of a trauma is less to do with how severe the event is but how severe it is percieved and processed by the individual.
-   Trauma is something that gets brought up a lot when discussing functional seizures. Trauma or a traumatic event is an event or incident which includes some form of harm either physical emotional or psychological.
-   This might be a single isolated incident (example car crash). Or it might be a more cumulative effect of lots of little things that happen over time (Example bullying).
-   Lots of people with functional symptoms have experienced some form of trauma, however there are also a subset of patients who have not.
-   When there is no trauma present, it can leave conditions feeling a little confused as to why the functional symptoms have developed. For some people, there may have been some form of trauma but which can no longer be remembered or is not recognised as being traumatic. For example so I might have had a close family bereavement, and the individual with functional symptoms may feel that this was unrelated to the functional symptoms, however it might be that overtime this is related.

## Rates of Stressful Life Events {visibility="hidden"}

Important Point

Although Rates are high, many people with FND do NOT report having experienced any trauma.

Our results show that the rate of childhood and adult stressful life events and maltreatment, particularly emotional neglect, is increased in patients with conversion (functional neurological) disorder compared with controls. The association was stronger in cases of childhood onset and when we compared with healthy controls as opposed to disease controls. However, a proportion of cases report no stressors. We concluded that stressors are relevant to the cause and development of conversion (functional neurological) disorder and therefore a potential treatment target, but exposure to such stressors is not an essential diagnostic feature. Our findings support the changes to DSM-5 and have implications for ICD-11.

"13 studies that specifically ascertained that the participants had not had either severe life events or any subtype of maltreatment all found a proportion of patients with functional neurological disorder reporting no stressor."

ILAE[^33] have forwarded the position of adopting `Functional Dissociative Seizure`

[^33]: International League Against Epilepsy

::: notes
The main reasons for changing are: 1) Almost everything in the universe is “nonepileptic”. 2) Patient organisations (FNDhope, FNDaction) want a different label. 3) International nosologies (DSM, ICD) use the terms “functional’ or “dissociative” seizures and it would be much better for all concerned if we could agree on a single term (although functional/dissociative seizures is clearly a compromise in this regard).

## Role of Psychology

-   Well suited to the treatment of FDS - but not necessary for all.

-   Co-morbidities needs to be accounted for.

![](files/img/smoke-not-fire.jpg){fig-align="center" width="400"}

::: notes
-   The paroxysmal role fairly well suited to psychological interventions (e.g., BT, CBT).

-   Otherwise may need to be team input.

-   MH should be treated irrespective of FND.

-   Some people with lots of health and MH comorbidities benefit from focused work on FND.

-   Some people need to work on the things underlying, which may be maintaining the FND.

-   For some people: If you spend time focusing on the smoke (core FND) but don't work on the underlying distress maintaining then treatment might not be effective and patients may relapse.

::: notes
-   Much of the evidence is on functional seizures.
-   Carlson 47% = seizure free; 82% = seizure reduction of at least 50%.
-   Not lots known about who doesn't respond; or long-term follow up.
-   non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS) may be effective
    -   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)

        Ttranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) 
:::

## Acceptability

-   Some patients ambivalent to treatment.

-   Doesn't always fit with patient view of difficulties.

-   Comes following a long journey.

-   High expectations.

## What to Measure? {background-color="white"}

-   Not just about the core FND symptoms.

-   7+ outcome measures used per study (unpublished study).[^40]

-   Core outcome battery and specific tools still lacking (for now).

## How to Measure? {background-color="white"}

. . .

Come see the workshop on measurement approaches in FND.

## Change Across Other Measures {background-color="white"} {visibility="hidden"}

In all conditions treatment remains effective (approx *d* = .5)

![Preliminary results being prepared for publication.](files/img/forest.png){width="1300" height="600"}

::: notes
-   Preliminary findings being prepared for publication.

-   There is hope: Functioning.

-   Long and behavioural treatments may have promise.

-   No evidence yet for schema therapy, mentalisation or CAT.
