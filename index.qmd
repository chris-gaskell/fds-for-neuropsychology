# Contents {background-color="#01364C" style="font-size: 35px; text-align: left;"}

-   Introduction

-   `Background` to Functional Dissociative Seizures

-   Importance of `Language` {{< fa comment-dots >}}

-   The `Evidence` base {{< fa chart-simple >}}

-   Approaches to `Measurement` {{< fa ruler >}}

::: notes
-   I am going to talk to you about FDS, focusing more on background and evidence, and then in about 25 minutes Antonia is going to to talk about delivering treatment.

-   There is lots that I would like to talk about however I don't really have that long with ou. So I am going to attempt to provide a general introduction, and then a whistle stop tour of:

    -   Language.

    -   Evidence for treatments.

    -   Approaches to measurement.

-   One manifestation/constellation of the FND umbrella {{< fa umbrella >}}.

-   `Functional` referring to an impairment of normal functioning.

::: notes
-   Lots of other terms to describe FDS (to discuss later).
-   Epilepsy but without the same underlying electrical processes. Different brain structural changes.
-   DSM-V-TR: Conversion disorder/Functional neurological symptom disorder.
-   Discrimination is essential for providing the most appropriate treatment.
-   Seizures are one manifestation, often within complex broader FND constellations.
-   FND is the umbrella term. If we see a diagnosis indicative of seizures then don't forget the myriad of other symptoms which may be impacting the person's ability to function.

## Functional Seizures {visibility="hidden"}

-   One manifestation/constellation of FND.

-   Within DSM-V classified as conversion disorder/functional neurological symptom disorder.

-   **"Functional"** referring to an impairment of normal functioning.

-   Disruption of usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception (Goldstein et al., 2000).

-   Temporary loss of **control and/or awareness**.

::: notes
-   The term functional has been used to describe symptoms which impacts upon neurological function but which do not have the same underlying pathological abnormality.
-   Dissociation: amnesia, fugue, dissociative id disorder, depersonalisation disorder)
:::

## Who Makes The Diagnosis?

Usually made by a Neurologist or Neuropsychiatrist.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Assessments can include:

-   Clinical history.

-   Videos & subjective experience.

-   EEG (electroencephalogram).

-   ECG (electrocardiogram).

-   Video telemetry.

:::

Any professional who potentially comes into contact with patients has a potential role in identification and/or clarification.

::: notes
-   In order to provide understanding and appropriate treatments we need accurate and prompt diagnosis. The importance of sensitively delivered diagnosis can't be overstated.

-   Establishing the diagnosis is challenging, particularly because of the need to carefully rule out epilepsy. it can require lots of assessments.

-   More assessments = more time. As the assessments are far from perfect it is common for FDS to be first misdiagnosed as epilepsy.

-   In order to increase the chance of an accurate diagnosis, it is important that the person is seen by someone who is particularly familiar seizure conditions.

-   **Video-telemetry:** inpatient admission so that the person can be observed and recorded having seizures.

-   Psychologists have a role in diagnosis too. Not making it, but often explaining it and helping the patient to make sense of it. Some people attend who report having not been told about the diagnosis.

::: notes
-   Are are not diagnosticians but I think it can be helpful, and interesting, to know some of the semiological features that are more reliable for discriminating between conditions.
:::

## Diagnostic Challenges

Difficult to distinguish from other conditions = long waits for diagnosis.

-   Long duration from onset to diagnosis[^4].

-   Functional seizures treated epileptic seizure protocols[^5].

-   Prolonged use of anti-convulsants.

-   Lack of access to necessary support and treatment.

::: notes
Just to reinforce some of the dilemmas around diagnosis.

-   Journey to diagnosis can be very long. When using gold standard assessment (VT) mean duration of 8.4 years (median = 3) ([Kerr et al., 2021](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1059131121000510?token=89B6F73BFDD3927128DB3620BA782BDC2C029A17A0DAE3B74C41E58725B0F2BC506713D8EBD8439C4A829038111E3159&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20230316115621))

-   Response to functional seizures with seizure protocols (very common, see [Jungilligens et al., 2021](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/early/2021/08/16/jnnp-2021-326443.full.pdf)).

-   Among 1210 patients presenting with prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) 8% went on to receive a diagnosis of FDS

## How Common Is FDS?

**Prevalence:** Challenging to calculate[^6].

[^6]: In the absence of well-resourced, formal epidemiological studies and confounded by diagnostic delays.

-   Norway: 24/100,000[^7] (95% CI = 18–30).
-   Subsequently estimated 50,000–100,000 people in the UK[^8].

**Incidence:**

-   Norway: 3.1/100,000 per year (95% CI = 2.4–3.7).

-   UK (older study): 4.09/100,000[^9].

**Healthcare:**

-   8-12% of presentations to first seizure clinics[^10].

-   11% of seizures presenting to emergency services[^11].

-   20–30% of patients referred to epilepsy centers with intractable seizures[^12].

[^12]: The vast majority of these patients are eventually diagnosed with PNES.

::: notes
-   It's difficult to accurately quantify prevalence rates.
-   Accurate data on the epidemiology of FDS are limited, with no UK population-level studies.
    -   May feel more common from working in neuropsychology; however it is still a rare condition.
-   Estimated that FDS accounts for:
    -   Approx 10% of people attending to a first seizure neurology clinic.
    -   Approx 10% of seizures that present to A&E.
    -   Approx a quarter of patients referred to epilepsy centers with intractable epilepsy.

::: notes
Lots of information out there about risk factors for FDS.

Take home point is that they don't consistently discriminate. No risk factor can explain every presentation of FDS and there is broadly a consensus that the cause of FDS for many people is likely to be multi-factorial.

In short, FDS is more common in women around the ages of 20 to 40, although modal age of onset is 16, and there are elevated rates of FDS in:

-   LD.

-   Sexual and gender minorities.

-   People of low SES.

-   Epilepsy, brain injury, migraine.

-   Physical and mental health comorbidities.

-   And trauma.

**Age:**

-   Modal age of onset is 16. mean and median = 28.

-   Age disparity dissipates in late adulthood.

**Epilepsy:**

-   12--22% Dual diagnosis (meta-analysis).

-   Challenging to diagnose

**LD:**

-   Median = 9.4% of comorbid ID was found across eleven PNES cohorts (Rawlings et al., 2021).

**Demographics:**

-   Over 50% of all patients live in areas categorised within the highest deprivation quintile

-   Over two- thirds of patients being unemployed at the point of seeking treatment for PNES (Goldstein *et al.*, 2019).

**Psychiatric:**

-   **PTSD:** 38%

-   Norm rather than an exception (Nicholson et al., 2020).

-   **Psychiatric conditions:** especially affective, trauma-related and/or dissociative disorders, are typically present in over 50% of most FND samples, with lifetime rates even higher.

-   **Personality disorders:** higher rate than the general population. Particularly EUPD and cluster C presentations.

-   **Epilepsy surgery:** New onset following surgery (upto 9%).

-   **TBI:** Rates vary a lot. Pooled frequency of about 42%
:::

## Trauma {visibility="hidden"}

-   **Traumatic event:** incident causing physical, emotional or psychological harm.

-   Single event or repeated incidents (i.e., complex).

-   Recent or a long time ago.

-   Highly common in FDS (compared to case controls, [Ludwig et al., 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/%20S2215-0366(18)30051-8)).

-   Does not consistently explain aetiology or onset.

-   Not always helpful to ask.

-   Be careful with the notions of conversion. It may be relevant for some [but not all]{.underline}.

::: notes
-   Trauma does not explain why one patient gets a seizure and another paralysis
-   Nor does an abusive experience 10 years ago explain why the symptom starts on the 7th Sept 2017
-   Sometimes more helpful to ask about the emotional reaction to sudden onset physical symptoms.
-   The magnitude of a trauma is less to do with how severe the event is but how severe it is percieved and processed by the individual.
-   Trauma is something that gets brought up a lot when discussing functional seizures. Trauma or a traumatic event is an event or incident which includes some form of harm either physical emotional or psychological.
-   This might be a single isolated incident (example car crash). Or it might be a more cumulative effect of lots of little things that happen over time (Example bullying).
-   Lots of people with functional symptoms have experienced some form of trauma, however there are also a subset of patients who have not.
-   When there is no trauma present, it can leave conditions feeling a little confused as to why the functional symptoms have developed. For some people, there may have been some form of trauma but which can no longer be remembered or is not recognised as being traumatic. For example so I might have had a close family bereavement, and the individual with functional symptoms may feel that this was unrelated to the functional symptoms, however it might be that overtime this is related.

Important Point

Although Rates are high, many people with FND do NOT report having experienced any trauma.

Our results show that the rate of childhood and adult stressful life events and maltreatment, particularly emotional neglect, is increased in patients with conversion (functional neurological) disorder compared with controls. The association was stronger in cases of childhood onset and when we compared with healthy controls as opposed to disease controls. However, a proportion of cases report no stressors. We concluded that stressors are relevant to the cause and development of conversion (functional neurological) disorder and therefore a potential treatment target, but exposure to such stressors is not an essential diagnostic feature. Our findings support the changes to DSM-5 and have implications for ICD-11.

"13 studies that specifically ascertained that the participants had not had either severe life events or any subtype of maltreatment all found a proportion of patients with functional neurological disorder reporting no stressor."

[^26]: Not related to the behavioural notion of 'functional analysis'

[^27]: See this video by [John Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ersm5f_0LVI&t=21s%22) or the excellent [review paper](https://www.bmj.com/content/380/bmj.p221) on 'functional' vs 'organic'

::: notes
-   The 'Functional vs. Organic' dichotomy is quite a dominant discourse, particularly in neuropsychology, but it's important to remind ourselves of the limitations of this distinction.

-   Functional vs organic fits the existing healthcare system quite well; but that is largely because our healthcare is heavily built on mind-body dualism; just look at the distinction between physical and mental health care. FND and FDS are conditions that illustrate very well how this distinction is certinaly not as clear cut as people think.

-   What organic symptoms are not in some way mediated by psychological processes? and if someone has limb weakness for many years, then could motor patterns not go on to influence brain structure through plasticity?

-   Functional, does not mean behavioural; it is an impairment of function.

-   Jon Stone makes an interesting point about the term organic being completely flawed, in an interesting paper called A tale of two turnips. I cannot do it justice, but maybe consider how anything in our very consciousness not be organic. Consciousness must arise from organic matter at some level. Structural.

ILAE[^28] have forwarded the position of adopting `Functional Dissociative Seizure`

[^28]: International League Against Epilepsy

::: notes
The main reasons for changing are: 1) Almost everything in the universe is “nonepileptic”. 2) Patient organisations (FNDhope, FNDaction) want a different label. 3) International nosologies (DSM, ICD) use the terms “functional’ or “dissociative” seizures and it would be much better for all concerned if we could agree on a single term (although functional/dissociative seizures is clearly a compromise in this regard).

# Treatment: Evidence & Measurement {background-color="#01364C" style="font-size: 35px; text-align: left;"}

## Role of Psychology

-   Well suited to the treatment of FDS - but not suited for all.

-   Co-morbidity needs to be accounted for.

![](files/img/smoke-not-fire.jpg){fig-align="center" width="400"}

::: notes
-   The paroxysmal role fairly well suited to psychological interventions (e.g., BT, CBT).

-   FND can respond; but may need MDT input.

-   MH should be treated irrespective of FND.

-   Some people with lots of health and MH comorbidities benefit from focused work on FND.

-   Some people need to work on the things underlying, which may be maintaining the FND.

-   For some people: If you spend time focusing on the smoke (core FND) but don't work on the underlying distress maintaining then treatment might not be effective and patients may relapse.

::: notes
-   Lots of evidence for treatments functional seizures; although much of it is quite low quality, and mostly focused upon behavioral and CBT interventions.
-   Most focuses on seizure reduction, which is understandable because that is usually what people want to change when they arrive for treatment.
-   The problem however is that the evidence for psychological treatments for seizures frequency is mixed. Practice-based studies tend to show very impressive rates of seizure freedom (roughly 1 in 2) however the one high quality RCT for FDS found no difference to standard care.
-   So some been argued that psychological treatment may be less influential than we would hope for seizure frequency; however there are a lot of methodological problems in outcome research for FDS, least of which is how to accurately measure and count seizures, so it is quite hard to conclude anything definitively. That said, RCTs have found far more impressive findings for other outcomes, such as mental health, functioning, and quality of life, to name just a few.
-   Not enough time to go into detail, but there isn't evidence supportive of medication, and there is some emerging evidence for neuro-modulation but it's far too early to say how effective or suitable they are.

## Acceptability

-   Some patients ambivalent to treatment.

-   Doesn't always fit with patient view of difficulties.

-   Comes following a long journey.

-   High expectations.
